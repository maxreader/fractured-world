[autoplace-control-description]
island-randomness=Parameters for Fractured World.\nScale typically adjusts the large scale randomness, whilst coverage adjusts small scall randomness. Some presets use them slightly differently, so experiment!
map-rotation="Size" changes the rotation in large increments. "Coverage" changes it in small increments.
overall-resources=Frequency changes the fraction of cells that are allowed to have ore. Size affects the island/grid spacing.
